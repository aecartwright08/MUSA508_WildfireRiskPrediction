# MUSA508_WildfireRiskPrediction

The submission for our MUSA508 Final is "MUSA508_final_Cartwright_MasudaFarkas.html", and the corresponding .rmd is titled the same. 

There is a more ambitious model I am still working on titled MUSA508_WildfireRiskPrediction. The data availability and raster wrangling from government data repositories has been a total slog, so I really just got to some conceptual breakthroughs around the time the project was due. Check back for this model in the future if you are interested.
